// main.cpp: Santiago Arias
// Description:

// Trees are an important subcategory of graphs. 
// Trees such as binary trees and red-black trees are important data structures 
// used throughout computer science. 
// Again it is hoped that this topic is mostly review for active participants in this class. 

// This assignment requires the implementation of a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm
// for a weighted undirected graph (Graph). 
// A spanning tree for a Graph 'g' is a tree that reaches all the nodes of the graph. 
// The cost for such a spanning tree is the sum of all the edge costs (weights) in 
// the spanning tree’s edge set. 
// Over all possible spanning trees, the MST is the one with the least total cost
// (it may not be unique).  

// Two efficient methods will be explained in this week’s Module, 
// namely 'Prim’s algorithm' and 'Kruskal’s algorithm'. 
// Additionally, the assignment makes the following simplifying assumptions about 
// the unweighted Graph:
// Graph is connected. 
// This assumption enables the following invariant: 
// - MST invariant states that the edge set for a MST must
// -- (i) consist of a set of (V-1) edges
// -- (ii) no edge can create a cycle. 
// Edge weights may be zero or non-negative. 
// Non-negative edge weights are not a requirement for constructing a MST, 
// but may simplify our implementation. 
// Edge weights are NOT necessarily different.

// --------------------------------------------------
// Update your Homework 2 graph class to add two more methods. 
// Add a constructor that can read in a graph from a file. 
// The file format will be an initial integer that is the node size of the graph 
// and the further values will be integer triples: (i, j, cost). 
// See Sample Test Data here (file: sample_data).

// Implement either the Prim or Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm. 
// These algorithms are similar in flavor to Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. 
// Links to these algorithms are provided besides being explained in the videos.

// The output for MST should be the cost and the tree (the edges).  
// The input will be provided on the website.

// More challenging is an extension to this problem discussed in Module 4 as extra credit,
// however, for the purpose of this Homework, no extra credit will be given. 
// This is to give each edge one of three colors. 
// Consider that a road may be a local street or a highway or a turnpike.  
// Many route finding algorithms find a least costly path constrained by what 
// type of road to take. 
// We mimic this with colors and ask that you compute MST where the edge colors 
// are a constraint, eg. all edges must be green. 
// You are welcome to try this problem but the peer grading should be based on the 
// simpler problem where there are no colors.
